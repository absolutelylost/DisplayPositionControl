note on fixing monitor alignment

in terminal, navigate to build folder for monitor system custom code.
run terminal prompt top run exe --> .\debug\{name of exe file}
monitor gives current coordinates
perform placement moves screens to desired location given in code

note* this may take 2 to 3 attempts i believe due to the stacking/snapping mechanism
